      <p>
        In the GroupHQ Demo, you can join and leave dynamically generated
        groups. These groups are ephemeral, meaning that theyâ€™ll expire after a
        set amount of time. They're also not real or user-made, but instead
        generated through the
        <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api" target="_blank"
          >OpenAI API</a
        >. So unfortunately, you won't be able to attend Goku's training
        session. If you want to check out a real-world example of an ephemeral
        group service, check out the inspiration for this project:
