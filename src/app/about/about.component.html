      <h1>What is GroupHQ?</h1>
      <p>
        GroupHQ is an application created as a training exercise for building
        and deploying reactive cloud-native applications through the use of
        Spring Boot, Project Reactor, Docker, and Kubernetes, with an emphasis
        on cloud-native principles, particularly based on the 15-factor app
        methodology.

      <h1>What can I do here?</h1>
      <p>
        In the GroupHQ Demo, you can join and leave auto-generated groups. These
        groups are ephemeral, meaning that theyâ€™ll expire after a set amount of
        time.
