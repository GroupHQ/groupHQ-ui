// By default, Cypress loads Typescript configuration from both your project's tsconfig.json and Cypress's tsconfig.json.
// The issue here is that the Angular project generated by the Angular CLI has sourceMap set to true in tsconfig.json,
// while Cypress's tsconfig.json has inlineSourceMap set to true. These Typescript compiler options are mutually exclusive,
// and thus, an error will occur when Cypress combines both configurations. We won't need the sourceMap option when
// working with Cypress E2E tests since we aren't relying on Angular to debug our tests.

// The purpose of this file is to disable the sourceMap option and to rely on the inlineSourceMap option that Cypress specifies.
// It does this by extending from the project's tsconfig.json and overriding the compilerOptions.sourceMap option.
// Cypress will automatically recognize this file and use it instead of the project's default tsconfig.json.
